#   POWER BI AND EXCEL: A LOVE STORY 📂❤️

# Power BI and Excel are like two best friends—they just click! But before you hit Load, here’s what you need to know:

# 📥 Getting Data vs. Importing Data
Power BI offers two ways to bring in data from Excel:

# 🔗 Getting Data (Live Connection)
Power BI stays linked to the Excel file.

Any changes in Excel automatically reflect in Power BI.

Best for dynamic reports that need real-time updates.

# 📦 Importing Data (Snapshot)
Power BI stores a copy of the data inside its model.

Changes in Excel won’t update in Power BI unless manually re-imported.

Ideal for archived reports or when performance matters.

# 🎯 Which One Should You Use?
Choose Getting Data if you need live updates.
Choose Importing Data if performance and stability are key.

🚀 Pro Tip: Always pick the method that best fits your project needs!
